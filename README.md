# solvation_shells

Molecular simulations for studying aqueous solvation shells and calculating free energies of de-coordination.

Classes and functions to run all the analysis are packaged in `solvation_shells`. Since this is not packaged to be installable, add the directory to your PYTHONPATH to access this code. Run the following in the command line or add it to your `.bashrc`:

```
export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/solvation_shells/:$PYTHONPATH"
```
