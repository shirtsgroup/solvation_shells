# Example for running the umbrella sampling simulations

This example runs the umbrella sampling simulations for Na$^+$ at infinite dilution and 1 bar.
The resulting data is in `/solvation_shells/data/umbrella_sampling/NaCl/OPC3/Sengupta_etal/Cdilute/P1bar/all_molecule/Na/`.

It uses parameters from `/solvation_shells/top/forOPC3/` and initial configurations from `/solvation_shells/examp
